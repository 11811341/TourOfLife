This example shows you, how the next epoch of the algorithm will give birth to the bottom left corner cell. No other cells are born, because they only have a maximum of 2 living neighbors.

Puffers are patterns, that move, just like spaceships, but they also leave behind other patterns as they traverse the simulation plane. These generated patterns are generally referred to as debris. This so-called frothing puffer for example generates 10 blinkers and 2 blocks each period, and it's a period 78 pattern.",

The reason you're looking at another puffer, is because this one, as it travels, spawns not only 2 rows of blocks, but also 2 waves, traveling away from it along the 2 possible diagonals. You see, as was probably expected at this point, it is possible to create patterns, that actually produce gliders. This is a very important feature, especially for future lessons. ",

It's main characteristic is that it periodically tiles the whole grid of Life. It does this in both space, and time, meaning it's a stable pattern and does not get destroyed over time. The concept is probably easier to imagine with a visual example, like the one you see above. This agar is called onion rings, since it consists of nested squares which together resemble the layers of an onion. (note: the example grid is NOT tiled infinitely, so it will actually get destroyed once the simulation is run)",

        "description": "Slightly more complex, a conduit is a pattern consisting of still lifes and/or oscillators, that can influence or move a different moving/active pattern like a glider, and just like the eater, retain it's form. An interesting example of this is the depicted beehive stopper. It's able to turn a glider, coming from one direction, into a beehive, which in turn can intercept another glider coming from the second upper diagonal. If you were to imagine a stream of gliders as a signal, this would be a way to intercept parts of it. This idea will soon be explored further.",

When a cluster of cells is categorized as a methuselah, it simply means, that it takes a large number of epochs to finally stabilize, ergo turn into a stable pattern. This is known as it's lifespan. Methuselahs are a prime example of what makes the Game of Life so interesting, since they demonstrate how a very small pattern can grow unimaginably. This methuselah is called herschel, because it looks like the letter h. It starts out with only 7 cells, and takes 128 epochs to finally stabilize, producing a number of other patterns in the process.",

        "description": "The gun might just be the most important pattern of this whole section. You have already seen how certain patterns like the puffer can create other patterns as they propagate, even gliders. A gun is a pattern that does not itself move, and periodically creates spaceships. Specifically the so-called Gosper glider gun is a period 30 oscillator which emits gliders. It was the first gun ever discovered, and it proved that patterns in Life can grow infinitely. If you haven't realized already, the glider gun can be used to simulate a continuous signal. This feature opens the 'gate' to the world of computer logic inside Life.",
